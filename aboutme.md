My name is Destini Hazelwood. This is a website I made to host both personal projects as well as the projects completed during my time at Lambda School.

I started out at a traditional university studying Data Science with an emphasis in Business. Unfortunately I had financial problems that stopped me from graduating, and that's a large part of what brought me to Lambda. I tried to just work and I tried to do nothing particularly future-focused and it felt wrong. I needed to be challenged. I needed to do something with my life. And one day I found Lambda, a school that you didn't have to pay for until you had a job and I began a new journey of new hope.
