## Jeopardy Question Categorie
This was my very first data science project at Lambda School. After only a month of learning basic visualization techniques, statistics, and linear algebra, this is the exploratory project I made.
I found the dataset browing [r/datasets](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/cj3ipd/jeopardy_dataset_with_349000_clues/). It had over 349,000 clues, as well as their questions, categories, values, round, episode date, and comments made by the host, Alex Trebek. 

And I.  
Was.  
Excited.

For my full exploratory analysis:
